<h2>Coproduct</h2>

The coproduct is the <b>dual</b> of the product. The dual is the same thing but in the opposite category.
<br>So we build the product diagram reverting the arrows :

Instead of having projections <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>, we have <b>injections</b> <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>.
<br>So this is the pattern : we fix two objects <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. An object <code>c</code> will match this pattern if it has two arrows coming to it from <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
<br>And to match which candidate is the best, we map the best match <code>c</code> to fake candidates <code>c'</code>.
<br>The existence of a unique morphism such as the diagram commutes permits to determine the best match.
<br>Commuting condition is expressed by 
<div class="formula">
i' = m o i
<br>j' = m o j
</div>

<h3>In terms of functions</h3>

What does coproduct mean in set theory ?
<br>The fact that we have thes injection means that we are embedding the sets <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> into <code>c</code>.
<br>Functions can shrink things, or not cover their whole codomain, they can be non injective or non surjective ; but we want <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> to be the best fit. We want to embed exactly <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> into <code>c</code>, no more and no less. This is just like the <b>union</b> of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.

<img class="margin border" src="img/union.jpg" alt="Union">

Every universal construction permits to build the best possible fit, it picks an ideal match.

But what happens when they overlap ? Or when <code>a</code> = <code>b</code> ?
<br>The union of a set with itself is the set itself. But there is an other possibility : the <b>discrimated union</b> ; we tag the elements in the discrimated union : this element comes from the left one, this element comes from the right one ; the set is duplicated.
<br><code>c</code> is in fact a discrimated union because we can easily build a morphism <code>m</code> from discriminated union to union ; <code>m</code> is unique and non-injective.

<img class="margin border" src="img/discriminated-union1.jpg" alt="Discriminated Union">

And we could not go the other way round.

Each element <code>x</code> should be mapped twice, a function can't do that.

<!-- ************************************* -->
<h3>In terms of types</h3>

Called a <b>tagged union</b> or <b>variant</b>.
<br>In many programming languages you have a union ; if you take the union of Integer and boolean, you will have either an integer or a boolean, not both.
<br>The simplest example is an enumeration, which is a union of things.
<br>
<br>So the canonical way to build a product is a pair, built into the language.
<br>A union, also called a <b>sum type</b>, is not usually built into the language but is easy to define.
<br>The canonical definition of a sum type of two types is called <code>Either</code>, taking in parameters two types <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
<br>In Haskell, <code>data Either = Left a | Right b</code> (Left a or Right b) ; <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code> corresponds to injections <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>.
<br>In C++ we would define a class with two constructors.
<br>
<br>This is a dual picture ; in product we have the functions <code>fst</code> and <code>snd</code> which can destroy the pair, extract and see what's inside a pair.
In coproduct we have functions which construct an <code>Either</code>. But can we extract stuff from an <code>Either</code> ?
<br>If we have an <code>x :: Either Int Bool</code>, to extract an Int, we need to write code that takes into account both possibilities, that will match either Right or Left ; this is called <b>pattern matching</b> ; Left and right are patterns.

<!-- ********************************************************************************* -->
<h2>The type system</h2>

Now that we have product type, sum type, unit type, void, we have pretty much of the foundations of the type system.
<br>
<br>Product types are the most visible ones, they may be built-in in Haskell or defined with generics in C++.
<br>All these constructs in Haskell are equivalent to a product : they store two floats, no more and no less.

<pre>
data Point = (Float, FLoat)
data Point = P Float Float
data Point{
    x :: Float,
    y :: Float
}
</pre>

<br>Why are these called products and sums ?
<br>A product comes from cartesian product, so it's undersandable.
<br>Coproduct is a union, which is a kind of sum of two sets.
<br>This will be precised in the next course.
