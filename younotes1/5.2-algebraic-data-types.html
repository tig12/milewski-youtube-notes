<h2>Product</h2>

Why is it an algebra ?
<br>We have products and sums just like in algebra.
<br>Product is sort of multiplication. It means that we have at least a <b>monoid</b>.
<br>A monoid has an operation (here multiplication) that is associative and has a unit.
<br>But does the product in types behave like multiplication ?

<ul class="spaced">
    <li><b>Symetry</b> (this is not needed for a monoid)
        <br>The product of numbers is symetric, but this is not true for the product of two types :
        <br>If we have types <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, the pair <code>(a, b)</code> is different from <code>(b,a)</code>. However they contain the same information, which means that they are isomorphic ; the isomorphism is called <code>swap</code>.
<pre>
swap :: (a, b) &rarr; (b, a)
swap p  = (snd p, fst p)
</pre>
        The inverse of <code>swap</code> is <code>swap</code>.
        <br>So multiplication is symetric up to isomorphism.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Associativity</b>
        <br>Are <code>((a, b), c)</code> and <code>(a, (b, c))</code> equivalent ? No.
        <br>No but these two types contain the same information, but re-arranged ; they are isomorphic.
        <pre>assoc :: ((a, b), c) = (a, (b, c))</pre>
        This function is an isomorphism, it has an inverse.
        <br>Associativity means that we can omit parentheses and simply write <code>(a, b, c)</code>.
        <br>So we just have tuples ; structs or records with multiple fields are just examples of this.
        <br>In classical algebra, this corresponds to <code>(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)</code>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <b>Unit</b>
        <br>What would be the type, which paired with any other type would give the same type ? This type should have only one element.
        <br><code>(a, ())</code> is isomorphic to <code>a</code>.
<pre>
munit(x, ()) = x
munit_inv(x) = (x, ())
</pre>
        It's like taking the cartesian product of a line and a point, it gives a line (not exactly the same line).
        <br>What we did for right unit can be done for left unit.
        <br>In classical algebra, this corresponds to <code>a * 1 = a</code>
    </li>
</ul>

So we have a monoid with respect to product.

<!-- ********************************************************************************* -->
<h2>Sum</h2>

<ul class="spaced">
    <li>
        <b>Symetry</b>
        <br><code>Either a b ~ Either b a</code> ; isomorphic
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <b>Associativity</b>
        <br>Similarily it is also associative up to isomorphism.
        <br>If we want to associate Eithers we can write data structures like
        <pre>data Triple = Left a | Middle b | Right c</pre>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <b>Unit</b>
        <br>The unit of sum is <code>Void</code>.
        <br><code>Either a Void</code> is isomorphic to a.
        <br>In classical algebra, corresponds to <code>a + 0 = a</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Algebra</h2>

So we have a second monoid. That's not all, we would like to combine these two monoids into something bigger.
<br>
<br>From algebra we have <code>a * 0 = 0</code>
<br>Is it true with types ? Is <code>(a, Void)</code> isomorphic to <code>Void</code> ?
<br>Constructing a pair (a, Void) is impossible because we can't give an element of type <code>Void</code> ; this pair is inhabited, which is the same as <code>Void</code>.
<br>
<br>From algebra we also have distributivity : <code>a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c</code>.
<br>This is true, up to an isomorphism : <code>(a, Either b c) ~ Either (a, b) (a, c)</code>.
<br>
<br>A structure lke this in algebra is called a <b>ring</b>, except that in a true ring, addition and multiplication have an inverse. Here we don't know how to substract something or divide by something.
<br>A structure like that is called a <b>rig</b> or <b>semi-ring</b>.
<br>
<br>What is the correspondance of <code>2 = 1 + 1</code> ?
<br>1 is the unit type. There are two possible values : left unit or right unit. We can call left unit <code>true</code>, and right unit <code>false</code>. 2 is isomorphic to a boolean.
<br>
<br>What is the correspondance of <code>2 = 1 + a</code> ?
<br>This is <code>Maybe</code> :
<br><code>data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a</code>.
<br>This has two constructors ; <code>Nothing</code> takes no argument, so it's equivalent to Unit.
<br>So <code>Maybe a</code> is equivalent to <code>Either () a</code>.
<br>
<br>Let's see an equation :
<br><code>l(a) = 1 + a * l(a)</code>
<br>Which can be solved as follows :
<br><code>l(a) - a * l(a) = 1</code>
<br><code>l(a) * (1 - a) = 1</code>
<br><code>l(a) = 1 / (1 - a)</code>
<br>
<br>Expressed as type, this gives :
<br><code>data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)</code>
<br>A list of <code>a</code> is either empty or it's a Cons of head and tail.
<br><code>List</code> a is a sum constructor (|)
<br><code>Nil</code> is a constructor that takes no argument, which corresponds to Unit type.
<br><code>Cons</code> is a product constructor, it takes two types as arguments.
<br>
<br>To solve this equation with types, we cannot do division or substraction.
<br>But <code>l(a) = 1 / (1 - a)</code> happens to be the sum of a geometric sequence : <code>1 + a + a*a + a*a*a + ...</code>
<br><code>1</code> corresponds to empty list ; <code>a</code> is a singleton list ; <code>a*a</code> is a list of 2 elements ; <code>a*a*a</code> is a list of 3 elements...
<br>With this equation we have defined all possible lists.
<br>
<br>The equation : <code>l(a) = 1 + a * l(a)</code> can be solved by substitution :
<br>Using classical algebraic notation :
<br><code>l(a) = 1 + a * (1 + a * l(a)) = 1 + a + a * a * (1 + a * l(a))</code> ...
<br>This is a way of doing the same thing without doing the power series.
